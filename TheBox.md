# The Box

The box (or boxes) need to be portable (or at least, transportable) and ruggedised, with internal partitions.

I would suggest a flight/road case like these :

## Box Contents

The box should contain:

* Contact details, stuck to the lid of the box
* Instructions on how to use the box
* An Inventory of the items within the box
* A 'Damaged Item' bag / tagging system (use coloured zipties?)
